# batch-remux
Converts all .mkv files to .mp4 files in a directory

## Usage

Place the remux.sh script inside the folder with the video files.
Run to make it executable.
```sh
chmod +x remux.sh
```
Run to start.
```sh
./remux.sh
```
Now wait for it to finish. It isn't going to delete the old mkv files.
